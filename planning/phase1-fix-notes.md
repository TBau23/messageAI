# Phase 1: Fix Notes

## Issue: Database Not Initialized

**Problem**: 
When opening React Native DevTools, saw warnings/errors that database was not initialized.

**Root Cause**:
With **expo-router**, the app entry point is `app/_layout.js`, not `App.js`. 
The database initialization was in the wrong file.

**Solution**:
Moved database initialization from `App.js` to `app/_layout.js` (the root layout).

### Changes Made:

#### `/app/_layout.js`
```javascript
// Added:
import { database } from '../utils/database';
const [dbInitialized, setDbInitialized] = useState(false);

// Initialize database on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const initDatabase = async () => {
    await database.init();
    console.log('✅ SQLite database initialized');
    setDbInitialized(true);
  };
  initDatabase();
}, []);

// Show loading until database ready
if (!dbInitialized) {
  return <ActivityIndicator />;
}
```

#### `/App.js`
Reverted database initialization (not used with expo-router).

### Result:
✅ Database now initializes before any screens load  
✅ No more "database not initialized" warnings  
✅ Proper expo-router integration  
✅ Loading spinner shows during init (~50-100ms)  

### Testing:
1. Reload app
2. Check console → Should see: `✅ SQLite database initialized`
3. No warnings in DevTools
4. App loads normally after brief init

## Expo Router Entry Point

For future reference, with **expo-router**:
- Entry point: `app/_layout.js` (root layout)
- NOT `App.js` (legacy, not used)
- NOT `index.js` (just calls registerRootComponent)

**Initialize global state here:**
- Database
- Network monitoring
- Auth listeners
- Any other app-wide setup

---

## Status: FIXED ✅

Database initialization now working correctly.
Ready for Phase 1 testing!

## Issue 2: NOT NULL Constraint Failed

**Problem**:
```
Error upserting message to cache: 
NOT NULL constraint failed: messages.conversation_id
```

**Root Cause**:
Firestore messages don't have `conversationId` as a field - it's part of the collection path:
```
conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
```

When caching messages, we were passing the raw Firestore document which didn't have the conversation ID.

**Solution**:
1. In `chatStore.js`, explicitly add `conversationId` when caching:
```javascript
await database.upsertMessage({
  ...message,
  conversationId: conversationId // From the path
});
```

2. In `database.js`, added validation to skip invalid messages:
```javascript
// Validate required fields before inserting
if (!conversationId) {
  console.warn('Skipping message cache: missing conversationId');
  return;
}
```

### Result:
✅ Messages cache successfully with conversationId  
✅ Better error messages if data is invalid  
✅ No more NOT NULL constraint errors

## Issue 3: Duplicate Keys in FlatList

**Problem**:
```
Encountered two children with the same key
Keys should be unique
```

**Root Cause**:
When loading conversations, we:
1. Load from cache first → Set conversations state
2. Firestore listener fires → Set conversations state again

Briefly, both cached and Firestore versions exist in the array, causing React to see duplicate keys.

**Solution**:
Added deduplication logic in `subscribeToConversations`:

1. Mark cached conversations with `_fromCache: true`
2. When Firestore updates arrive, filter out duplicates:
```javascript
const firestoreIds = new Set(convos.map(c => c.id));
const cachedOnly = currentConversations.filter(
  c => c._fromCache && !firestoreIds.has(c.id)
);
const dedupedConvos = [...convos, ...cachedOnly];
```

3. Firestore data always wins (source of truth)
4. Keep cached conversations only if not in Firestore yet

### Result:
✅ No duplicate keys in FlatList  
✅ Smooth transition from cache to Firestore  
✅ Cache loads fast, Firestore replaces seamlessly

## Issue 4: Console Warnings (Read Receipts & WebChannel)

**Problem**:
Lots of console warnings:
1. `WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream transport errored`
2. `Skipping read receipt update: No document to update`

**Root Cause**:
1. **WebChannel warnings**: Normal Firestore SDK connection management in dev mode
2. **Read receipt warnings**: Trying to update read receipts on cached messages before they're confirmed in Firestore

When we load from cache, messages have IDs but might not exist in Firestore yet (or might be stale). The app was trying to mark these as read immediately.

**Solution**:

1. **Mark cached messages**:
```javascript
const cachedProcessed = cachedMessages.map(message => ({
  ...message,
  _fromCache: true, // Flag cache-sourced messages
}));
```

2. **Filter in chat screen**:
```javascript
const unreadMessages = messages.filter(
  msg => !msg._fromCache && // Skip cache-only messages
         msg.senderId !== user.uid &&
         !(msg.readBy || []).includes(user.uid)
);
```

3. **Silently handle "not found" errors**:
```javascript
.catch((error) => {
  // Silently skip non-existent messages
  if (!error.message?.includes('No document')) {
    console.warn('Read receipt update error:', error.message);
  }
});
```

4. **Batch updates** to avoid overwhelming Firestore (10 at a time)

### Result:
✅ Drastically reduced console warnings  
✅ Only update receipts on Firestore-confirmed messages  
✅ Cache messages don't trigger unnecessary updates  
✅ WebChannel warnings remain (normal in dev mode)  

**Note**: WebChannelConnection warnings are from Firestore SDK and are expected in development with hot-reloading. They're harmless and disappear in production builds.

## Status: ALL FIXED ✅

All four issues resolved. Database fully functional and clean console!
Ready for Phase 1 testing!
