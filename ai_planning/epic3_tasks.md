## Implementation Notes

### Recommended Order
1. **Backend First:** Tasks 3.1-3.4 (can deploy and test independently)
2. **Core UI:** Tasks 3.5-3.7 (build interaction and display)
3. **Integration:** Tasks 3.8-3.9 (connect frontend to backend)
4. **Hardening:** Tasks 3.10-3.12 (error handling and edge cases)
5. **Validation:** Tasks 3.13-3.15 (thorough testing)

### Key Dependencies
- `firebase-functions` v2 (already installed)
- `openai` or AI SDK (already configured)
- `react-native-gesture-handler` (likely already available via Expo)
- `@react-native-community/haptics` or Expo Haptics

### Performance Targets
- Long-press recognition: <500ms
- Action sheet display: <100ms
- API response time: <3s (target <2s)
- Modal animation: smooth 60fps
- Cache retrieval: <50ms

### Cost Optimization
- Use GPT-4o-mini (not GPT-4o) for explanations
- Cache aggressively (30-day TTL)
- Rate limit to 50/day per user
- Efficient prompts to minimize tokens
