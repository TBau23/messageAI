# Read Receipt UX Improvement

## Problem
Read receipts were appearing under **every single message** sent by the logged-in user that had been read by other participants. This cluttered the UI and made it unclear where the recipient had actually read up to.

### Before
```
User A: Message 1 ✓ Read
User A: Message 2 ✓ Read  
User A: Message 3 ✓ Read
User A: Message 4 (no receipt - not read yet)
```

## Solution
Read receipts now only appear under the **most recently read message**, following WhatsApp's UX pattern. This gives users a clear indication of "they've read up to this point."

### After
```
User A: Message 1
User A: Message 2  
User A: Message 3 ✓ Read
User A: Message 4 (no receipt - not read yet)
```

## Implementation

### Changes Made
**File**: `app/(main)/chat/[id].js`

1. **Added `getLastReadMessageId()` function** (lines 293-334):
   - Filters messages to only those sent by the current user
   - Iterates from newest to oldest
   - For **direct chats**: Finds the most recent message read by the other user
   - For **group chats**: Finds the most recent message read by at least one participant
   - Returns the ID of that message (or `null` if no messages have been read)

2. **Modified `renderMessage()` function** (lines 336-410):
   - Added `shouldShowReadReceipt` flag (line 350)
   - Only shows `MessageStatusIndicator` when `shouldShowReadReceipt` is `true`
   - This ensures only one message displays the read receipt at a time

### Logic Examples

#### Scenario 1: Direct Chat
```
User A sends: M1, M2, M3
User B reads: M1, M2
User A sends: M4 (not read)

Result: Read receipt appears only under M2
```

#### Scenario 2: Group Chat
```
User A sends: M1, M2, M3
User B reads: M1, M2
User C reads: M1
User A sends: M4 (nobody has read)

Result: Read receipt appears only under M2
(the last message read by anyone)
```

#### Scenario 3: All Messages Read
```
User A sends: M1, M2, M3
User B reads: all of them

Result: Read receipt appears only under M3
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Eliminates visual clutter from duplicate read receipts
2. **Clear Communication**: Users can instantly see "they've read up to here"
3. **WhatsApp-Style UX**: Follows familiar messaging app patterns
4. **Works for Both**: Handles direct chats and group chats appropriately

## Technical Details

- **No breaking changes**: The `MessageStatusIndicator` component remains unchanged
- **Backward compatible**: All existing message data structures remain the same
- **Performance**: Efficiently calculates on each render using filtered array iteration
- **No mutations**: Uses `.slice()` before `.reverse()` to avoid mutating the original messages array

## Testing Checklist

### Read Receipt Logic
- [ ] Direct chat: Send multiple messages, have recipient read some (not all)
  - Verify read receipt only on last read message
- [ ] Direct chat: Have recipient read all messages
  - Verify read receipt only on most recent message
- [ ] Direct chat: Send new message after recipient has read previous ones
  - Verify read receipt stays on last read message (not the new unread one)
- [ ] Group chat: Multiple participants read different messages
  - Verify read receipt on the most recent message read by anyone
- [ ] Group chat: Tap read receipt to see detailed status modal
  - Verify modal still shows per-user read status correctly

### Layout Fix
- [ ] Send short messages (like "Ok", "Nice", "Oof")
  - Verify message text doesn't shift left when read receipt appears
- [ ] Send messages of varying lengths
  - Verify all messages stay aligned to the right consistently
- [ ] Compare messages with and without read receipts
  - Verify consistent alignment and no layout jumps

## Layout Fix (CSS Issue)

### Problem
When a read receipt appeared under a message, the message text would shift to the left, especially for short messages like "Oof" or "Nice". This happened because:

1. The message container expands to fit whichever child is wider (bubble or status indicator)
2. When the status indicator was wider, the container expanded
3. The message bubble wasn't explicitly aligned, so it would shift left

### Solution
Added `alignSelf: 'flex-end'` to the `myMessageBubble` style in `app/(main)/chat/[id].js`:

```javascript
myMessageBubble: {
  backgroundColor: '#DCF8C6',
  alignSelf: 'flex-end',  // Added this
},
```

This ensures that even when the container expands to fit a wide status indicator, the message bubble stays aligned to the right edge, preventing the text shift.

### Before Fix
```
           Nice     ← Message shifted left
Read at Oct 24, 5:24 PM
```

### After Fix
```
                Nice     ← Message stays aligned right
Read at Oct 24, 5:24 PM
```
